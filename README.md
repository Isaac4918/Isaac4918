### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Isaac Araya Solano, I'm 23 years old and I'm currently a Computer Engineering Student at the Costa Rican Institute of Technology.

I'm currently learning to create databases, develop web sites and how to analyze the algorithms I code for them to be as efficient as possible.
Also I'm now starting to learn how to program and develop videogames with Unity. 

I have some experience in Python, Java, C++, C#, SQL and a little experience on React and Javascript. You can check some of my work on my repositories.

I'm looking to collaborate on projects from different areas to learn as much as possible about technology and software development in order to become the best professional I can be.
