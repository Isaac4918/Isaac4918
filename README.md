### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Isaac Araya Solano, I'm 23 years old and I'm currently a Software Engineering Student at the Costa Rican Institute of Technology.

I consider myself a very social person, a very analytical person and a great teamworker with ease of speech. Also, I am a really fast learner and I can easily adapt to changes.

I'm currently learning to create and manage databases, how to develop web sites with React JS and Angular, and how to program and develop videogames with Unity.

I have some experience in Python, Java, C++, C#, SQL, Git and a little experience on React and Javascript. You can check some of my work on my repositories.

I'm looking to collaborate on projects from different areas to learn as much as possible about technology and software development in order to become the best professional I can be.
